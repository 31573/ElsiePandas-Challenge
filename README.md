•	Sum the total budget
•	Calculate the average math  and reading scores 
•	Calculate the % of students who scored above 70 in math

•	Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
•	Math scores and Reading scores by grade level
•	Scores by school spending

Create bins and summarize by school size and school type.
•	Average math score
•	Average reading score
•	% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
•	% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
•	% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

What 2 conclusions  can be drawn from the calculations performed.
